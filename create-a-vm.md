# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM
In the first VM lab I made an Ubuntu VM  


## Your second VM
This time I'm running WIndows 10  
There were no issues getting it started.  
It's been given 4 GB of RAM and 60 GB of Storage. These were on the upper limits of what was suggested and my system has plenty to spare.  
Allocating too much RAM to the VM could potentially introduce performance issues within the host system if the VM is provisioned too much RAM leaving the Host with not enough to coninue it's normal processes.  
I enabled 3D acceleration and allocated more Video Memory because the VM was having trouble rendering some things on screen without these additional resources.  
After changing these settings performance was much smoother with a notable increase in the framerate of certain windows animations (like the cursor).  
Depending on the applications/processes running within the VM, it could be important to add additional CPU/RAM resources to optimize the performance of VM.
